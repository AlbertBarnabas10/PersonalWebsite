                am also a final year student at BINUS University. I have
                passionate about UI UX and Product Design for about a year and
                half. I like to help people solve their problems with Design. My
                goal is to become a Product Designer or UX Engineer until I
                build my own creative agency. Majoring in Information Systems, I
                am into Product Design that much, I also learn how to code. For
                your information, I code this website myself using ReactJS +
                Tailwind CSS. As a UI UX Designer learn how to code helps me
                design with two POVs at the same time. */}
                    Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm an enthusiastic UI/UX Designer currently
                    interning at Brainworx Solusi Integrasi and navigating my
                    final year at BINUS University. My love for all things
                    design has been brewing for about a year and a half now. I
                    get a kick out of using design to solve real problems and
                    make people's lives a bit easier. Dream big, right? My goal
                    is to become a Product Designer or UX Engineer and, hey,
                    maybe even start my own creative agency down the road!
                    Despite majoring in Information Systems, I've caught the
                    coding bug. By the way, this website? Yeah, I whipped it up
                    myself using ReactJS + Tailwind CSS. Learning to code lets
                    me see design from multiple angles simultaneously. Let's
                    talk about design, tech, or anything cool that's on your
                    mind!
